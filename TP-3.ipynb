        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will learn how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain in Python. RAG systems combine information retrieval and natural language generation to produce answers that are grounded in external knowledge bases. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large documents or datasets where direct querying isn’t efficient or possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understand the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
        "- Learn how to use LangChain to implement a RAG system.\n",
        "- Implement the system step by step with guided TODO tasks.\n",
        "- Test your implementation at each step.\n",
        "- Provide helpful explanations and definitions.\n",

        "- VectorStore (FAISS): A tool for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",

        "- RetrievalQA Chain: Combines retrieval and question-answering over documents.\n",

        "### Data Used\n",
        "\n",
        "- I extracted some chapters of the Gen AI course as a txt file.\n",
        "- The goal how this notebook is to build a RAG system that can answer questions based on the content of these chapters."
