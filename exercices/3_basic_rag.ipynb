    "## Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain in Python. RAG systems combine information retrieval and natural language generation to produce answers that are grounded in external knowledge bases. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large documents or datasets where direct querying isnâ€™t efficient or possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "- Learn how to use LangChain to implement a RAG system.\n",
    "- Implement the system step by step with guided TODO tasks.\n",
    "- Test your implementation at each step.\n",
    "- Provide helpful explanations and definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain: A library for building language model applications.\n",
    "- VectorStore (FAISS): A tool for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",
    "- OpenAI Embeddings: Representations of text that can capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "- RetrievalQA Chain: Combines retrieval and question-answering over documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- I extracted some chapters of the Gen AI course as a txt file. \n",
    "- The goal how this notebook is to build a RAG system that can answer questions based on the content of these chapters."

Data preprocessing is crucial, involving cleaning, deduplication, and filtering. Scaling laws guide model and data size based on compute resources.  Training involves tuning hyperparameters on smaller models before scaling up. Cost and optimization are major considerations.\n",
      "* **Fine-tuning:** Aligning LLMs to follow instructions is done through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).  SFT uses human-labeled data to improve instruction following, while RLHF uses a reward model and algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align with human preferences. Evaluation remains a challenge. Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting improves reasoning abilities.\n",

      "**Transformers:** The core architecture of LLMs. Key components include:\n",
      "* **Self-Attention/Cross-Attention:** Mechanisms that allow the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence. Multi-head attention allows for parallel processing of these relationships.\n",
      "* **Other components:** Residual connections, layer normalization, feed-forward layers, softmax layer, and positional embeddings.  These work together to enable efficient training and effective representation of sequential data. Pre-transformer architectures like N-grams, RNNs, and LSTMs are also discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** This technique enhances LLMs by connecting them to external knowledge sources. Key aspects include:\n",
      "* **Information Retrieval:**  Methods like TF-IDF, BM25, cosine similarity, and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) are used for retrieving relevant information.  Sparse and dense retrieval methods are discussed, along with hybrid approaches.\n",
      "* **Vectorstores:**  Specialized databases for storing and querying vector embeddings of documents.  Efficient similarity search methods like ScaNN, FAISS, and HNSW are important.\n",
