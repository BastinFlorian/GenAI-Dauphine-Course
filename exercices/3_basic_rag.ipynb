    "## Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain in Python. RAG systems combine information retrieval and natural language generation to produce answers that are grounded in external knowledge bases. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large documents or datasets where direct querying isnâ€™t efficient or possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "- Learn how to use LangChain to implement a RAG system.\n",
    "- Implement the system step by step with guided TODO tasks.\n",
    "- Test your implementation at each step.\n",
    "- Provide helpful explanations and definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain: A library for building language model applications.\n",
    "- VectorStore (FAISS): A tool for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",
    "- OpenAI Embeddings: Representations of text that can capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "- RetrievalQA Chain: Combines retrieval and question-answering over documents.\n",

      "content=\"The document covers several key aspects of Large Language Models (LLMs), including their training, architecture, and applications. Here's a summary of the key points:\\n\\n**Building LLMs:**\\n\\n* **Training Process:** LLMs are trained in two phases: pre-training and post-training. Pre-training involves predicting the next word in a sequence, using cross-entropy loss and techniques like byte-pair encoding for tokenization.  Scaling laws guide the optimal model and data size based on compute resources. Post-training aims to align the model with human preferences, often using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or more recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\\n* **Cost and Optimization:** Training LLMs is computationally expensive. Optimizations focus on efficient data preprocessing, scaling laws, and techniques like PPO and DPO.\\n* **Evaluation:** Perplexity is a common evaluation metric, though now superseded by benchmark datasets like IFEval, BBH, and MMLU-Pro. Evaluating alignment is challenging and relies on methods like Chatbot Arena. Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting improves reasoning abilities.\\n\\n**Transformer Architecture:**\\n\\n* **Evolution:**  Transformers evolved from earlier models like N-grams, RNNs, and LSTMs, addressing limitations like vanishing gradients and limited context windows.\\n* **Key Components:** Core components include self-attention (and cross-attention for tasks like translation), multi-head attention, residual connections, layer normalization, feed-forward layers, a softmax layer for prediction, and positional embeddings.\\n* **Attention Mechanism:** This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when generating output. It involves Query, Key, and Value matrices.  Multi-head attention allows the model to attend to different aspects of the input simultaneously.\\n\\n**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**\\n\\n* **Architecture:** RAG combines LLMs with external knowledge sources. It retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base or document store based on the user's query and uses this information to augment the LLM's prompt.\\n* **Retrieval Methods:**  Retrieval methods include TF-IDF, BM25, cosine similarity, and Euclidean distance.  Sparse, dense, and hybrid retrieval approaches are used.\\n* **Vectorstores:** Vector databases store and manage vector embeddings of documents, enabling efficient similarity search. Methods like ScaNN, FAISS, and HNSW optimize retrieval.\\n* **Optimization Techniques:** Query augmentation, rephrasing, reranking, and prompt engineering are used to improve retrieval and generation quality.\\n* **Multimodal RAG:** Extends RAG to incorporate multiple data types, such as images and text, using multimodal LLMs.\\n* **SOTA Architectures:**  Advanced RAG architectures include Self-RAG, RAPTOR, and Corrective RAG.\\n\\nThis summary provides a high-level overview of the document's key concepts related to LLMs, Transformers, and RAG.  Each section contains more detailed explanations and specific techniques.\\n\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run-8b4270aa-da68-4baa-b23d-84d0014bcbef-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 29117, 'output_tokens': 627, 'total_tokens': 29744, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"
