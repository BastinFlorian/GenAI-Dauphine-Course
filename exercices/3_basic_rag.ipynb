    "## Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain in Python. RAG systems combine information retrieval and natural language generation to produce answers that are grounded in external knowledge bases. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large documents or datasets where direct querying isn’t efficient or possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "- Learn how to use LangChain to implement a RAG system.\n",
    "- Implement the system step by step with guided TODO tasks.\n",
    "- Test your implementation at each step.\n",
    "- Provide helpful explanations and definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain: A library for building language model applications.\n",
    "- VectorStore (FAISS): A tool for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",
    "- OpenAI Embeddings: Representations of text that can capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "- RetrievalQA Chain: Combines retrieval and question-answering over documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- I extracted some chapters of the Gen AI course as a txt file. \n",
    "- The goal how this notebook is to build a RAG system that can answer questions based on the content of these chapters."

      "Question: How to train an LLM ?\n",
      "Answer: LLM training involves two phases: pre-training and post-training. Pre-training uses a massive text dataset and cross-entropy loss to predict the next word in a sequence, teaching the model language structure and semantics. Post-training refines the model's ability to follow instructions and align with human preferences.  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) uses human-written examples to guide the model's responses. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) further improves alignment by training a reward model based on human preferences and using it to optimize the LLM's output. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a newer, simpler alternative to RLHF that directly optimizes the model based on human preferences.\n",

      "Question: What's an encoder \n",
      "Answer: An encoder is a component of a transformer model that processes input sequences, such as text or images, and transforms them into a contextualized representation. It uses self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between different parts of the input sequence, allowing the model to understand the overall meaning and context.  The encoder's output is a sequence of vectors, where each vector represents a part of the input and its relationship to other parts. In tasks like machine translation, the encoder's output is then passed to a decoder, which generates the translated sequence.  In other tasks, like text classification, the encoder's output can be directly used for prediction.\n",
